Blackjack GameSite
==========

This is the Blackjack game I've been working on as a basic website. Overall, the game works but there are a few bugs and somethings I can do to improve it.

You can start by hitting the shuffle button to get a quick peek at the cards so you know they are random. When your ready hit the deal button you will see your two cards, your hand and the dealers cards. If you want more cards you can ask for more with the hit me button. If not, hit the other button. One bug is that sometimes it will say you win or lose before you even deal, bit of a spoiler. No matter what it says you can always ask for more cards.

I could improve this game by adding a betting system and some form of money, as well as clean up the colors. I also debated having all of the interaction on the same htlm element instead having them of scrolling down.

PS This was a great learning experience. I built this organically with lots of trial and error. I'm sure I could have planned it better and made it more dry. A good lesson for next time.
